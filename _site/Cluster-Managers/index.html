<h1 id="cluster-managers">Cluster Managers</h1>

<p>Cloud-based infrastructure, containers, and new programming platforms are dominating and sweeping across IT departments across the world</p>

<p>The advancement of <strong>container development</strong> is one of the most widely adopted technologies in all of IT.</p>

<p>Cluster Managers are important in the tech landscape because they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standardize and automate container resources</li>
  <li>resolve failures quickly</li>
  <li>are essential tools in container <strong>orchestration</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-problems-do-cluster-managers-solve">What problems do Cluster Managers Solve?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Helps DevOps teams maange a group of clusters through a graphical user interface using the command line</li>
  <li>Monitor nodes in the cluster</li>
  <li>Configure services</li>
  <li>Administer the entire cluster server</li>
  <li>Involvment activities
    <ul>
      <li>sending work from cluster to cluster</li>
      <li>load-balancing and availability</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="competitors">Competitors</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Red Hat Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager)
    <ul>
      <li>if the company is using virtual machines instead of containers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cluster-managers-in-the-technology-landscape">Cluster Managers in the technology landscape?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Essential for  growing companies when scaling up with containers</li>
  <li>Container scaling is very hard without a container orchestration tool</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challenges-with-the-technology">Challenges with the technology</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cluster manager set-up can vary, some shorter, some longer
    <ul>
      <li>Kubernetes takes longer to learn/set up than Docker Swarm</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A lot  to learn for DevOps teams</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-did-it-come-from">Where did it come from?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Need to manage a rapidly growing and dynamically scaling cluster of Docker Containers.</li>
  <li>Computing changed from deploying software to virtual machines, to <em>containers</em>,  standardized units for development, shipment, and deployment.
    <ul>
      <li>They are known for being lightweight, standardized, and secure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Containers
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS with other containers</li>
      <li>Isolated from other containers on same machine</li>
      <li><em>Take less space than VMâ€™s</em></li>

<ul>
  <li>Definitely
    <ul>
      <li>With the growing spread of container adoption vs VM, cluster managers are definitely a growing technology.</li>
    </ul>
