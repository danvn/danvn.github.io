Teslas can drive forever on the highway without knowing where they are going. They follow the guidelines, and the crowd in front of them. If you don't put a destination in, you won't ever arrive, but you <i>will</i>, however keep going, and going, and going, with no clear intention of getting anywhere. 

However if you give that car a driver, you're going to get somewhere 999,999 times out of a million. It's because the driver <b>needs to be somewhere</b>. In fact, the driver knew where he or she needed to be before he even began the drive. 

<b>Setting</b> specific goals is the key to <i>reaching</i> them. 

It is obviously human nature to want to be successful. Every person wants to be successful, but not all can put in words what success means to them <i>personally</i>. A man who clearly defines his own goals and vision of success will achieve them. As does a car with a driver, who knows where they need to be. 
A man who who wants to be "successful", without knowing what success means to him will not. He doesn't know where he's going; he's in a Tesla (not a real one, the first guy is probably in a Tesla) driving down his road of life without setting his destination. 

This is the difference between having drive, and driving (mindlessly). Intention to get somewhere is key. 

Earl Nightingale's book <u>The Stangest Secret</u> paints it clearly. 

<b><i>We become what we think about</i></b>

Simply put, believe and achieve. 

I took him up on his proposed <b>30 Day Challenge</b>

1. For the next 30 days take control of your mind.  
* Each day do more than you have to do while maintaining a cheerful positive outlook, give of yourself more than you’ve ever done before.  
* Do this knowing that your returns in like must be in direct proportion to what you give.
2. The moment you decide on a goal, you are immediately a successful person.  
3. Don’t concern yourself to much with how you’re are going to achieve your goal.  Just know that you’re going to do it.
* <b>Definitely the most important to me</b>

<b>Goal: Get an internship at Nike for Summer 2017</b> 

I started setting clear goals

- Apply online 

That was really easy.
I've applied for the past 2 years and have been rejected by a robot e-mail every single year. I had a suspicion that my resume wasn't even getting read at all, so this year I knew I had to set myself apart some way or another.

- Set myself apart

I developed a master scheme. I would create a video introduction of myself, because I felt that paper couldn't represent how well I would fit into Nike, a good fit for the department and Just Do It culture are probably the #1 driving incentives for Nike HR, Recruitment, and Talent Acquisition. It took me a whole lot of time to film myself, script, and edit, but creating this video allowed me to <b>believe</b>  that it would bring me closer.

- Make sure somebody sees it

To get my introduction seen, I had to do some research. I looked up "Nike HR" on [LinkedIn](http://www.LinkedIn.com "LinkedIn").
I saw a whole bunch of recruiters and immediately knew I was going to <b>cold e-mail</b> all of them. Unfortunately, their e-mails weren't on their LinkedIn accounts, so I literally took their names and guessed/assumed that it would be `firstname.lastname@nike.com`.

I sent out at least 20 guessed e-mails, and only got 4 mail daemon errors of the e-mail not existing, but for a week, nobody replied. 

- Find / Create a way in

Again, on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com "LinkedIn"), I devised a new strategy. I looked up "Nike Intern" and I found someone who had a title of "Incoming Nike Technology Intern" which is the position I applied for as well as the Digital Internship. I didn't have any common connections but I thought hey, there's nothing to lose in trying. I connected with Natalia and asked her how long it took for her hiring process. She told me about how she applied through the campus and that she got an offer within like 2 weeks!

<i> I learned that people will almost always help if you ask them to. 

Natalia learned that I had no contacts with Nike, so she offered to help me out! She gave me the e-mail of the HR that helped her during her onboarding process. I sent the HR an e-mail and after a week of limbo I got a reply from Nike. After 2 phone interviews, I got an e-mail with an offer to Nike for an internship this summer! 

The best part of the process was finding out after I was hired, <b>no one even watched my damn video that I put 10-15 hours into</b>. During my phone interview, I asked her if she saw my introduction video I attached and she said no! LMAOOOO 
As you can see, I only got 1 view from Oregon (Nike HQ is located in Beaverton, OR), and I talked to 3 people who I sent it to. And the viewer only watched half the video before clicking away.
