# Kubernetes

## What does Kubernetes Solve?
- Kubernetes is a container cluster manager.
- It's an open-source platform for 
	- automating deployment
	- scaling
	- operations of application containers across clusters of hosts
- Provides container-centric infrastructure

**Goal:**
Kubernetes fosters an ecosystem of components and tools that relieve the burden of running applications in public and private clouds.


Kubernetes is...

- **Portable**: public, private, hybrid, multi-cloud
- **Extensible**: modular, pluggable, hookable, composable
- **Self-healing**: auto-placement, auto-restart, auto-replication, auto-scaling

## Competitors
- Container Managing Systems
	- Docker Swarm
	- Apache Mesos
	- CoreOS RKT
	- Linux Cluster Manager 

## Kubernetes's Role in the Technology Landscape
- Cluster Manager
	- Manage a cluster of Linux containers as a single system to accelerate Dev and simplify Ops


## Challenges with Kubernetes
- Takes some time to get up and running
- Installation instructions differ from OS to OS 
- Load balancing requires manual service configuration
- Incompatible with existing Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) and compose  tools

## Where did Kubernetes come from?
- Designed from the ground up to be a system for building, running and managing distributed systems.
- Originates from Google in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

	- Why: develop apps in a consistent manner, saving time and minimizing complexity 
	- What: Built a **centralized platform** for use across the enterprise
		- used container technology as the core of the platform
	- Results: Built an enterprise-wide platform for delivering innovated, web-based educational content. 
		- Expect engineers productivity to increase 20%
- box
	- Chose to develop platform with containers instead of virtual machines
	- Results: Reduction from 6 months to launch a service to an average of 6 weeks

## Future of Kubernetes
- Bright future
- Great and growing open-source contributing community
- Development of Kubernetes has been happening at light-speed in the past year
- Community has grown into a legitimate powerhouse of dev talent

- Companies need quicker deployment, which is why companies are flocking towards containers
