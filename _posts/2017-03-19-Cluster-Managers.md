# Cluster Managers

Cloud-based infrastructure, containers, and new programming platforms are dominating and sweeping across IT departments across the world

The advancement of **container development** is one of the most widely adopted technologies in all of IT. 


Cluster Managers are important in the tech landscape because they:

- standardize and automate container resources 
- resolve failures quickly
- are essential tools in container **orchestration** 

## What problems do Cluster Managers Solve?
- Helps DevOps teams maange a group of clusters through a graphical user interface using the command line
- Monitor nodes in the cluster
- Configure services 
- Administer the entire cluster server 
- Involvment activities
	- sending work from cluster to cluster 
	- load-balancing and availability 

## Competitors
- Red Hat Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager)
	- if the company is using virtual machines instead of containers 

## Cluster Managers in the technology landscape?
- Essential for  growing companies when scaling up with containers
- Container scaling is very hard without a container orchestration tool

## Challenges with the technology
- Cluster manager set-up can vary, some shorter, some longer
	- Kubernetes takes longer to learn/set up than Docker Swarm
- A lot  to learn for DevOps teams 

## Where did it come from?
- Need to manage a rapidly growing and dynamically scaling cluster of Docker Containers. 
- Computing changed from deploying software to virtual machines, to *containers*,  standardized units for development, shipment, and deployment. 
	- They are known for being lightweight, standardized, and secure. 
- Containers
	- Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS with other containers
	- Isolated from other containers on same machine 
	- *Take less space than VM's*

- Docker Swarm
- Mesos 
- Mesosphere

## What applications, software or websites use this technology?
- All companies that have growing and scaling container based development environments

## Where do you see this technology in a year?  Will it still be relevant?
- Definitely
	- With the growing spread of container adoption vs VM, cluster managers are definitely a growing technology.
